    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
      It is a general-purpose programming language that is concurrent,
      class-based, and object-oriented, which means it can be used to create
      applications that can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine
      (JVM). Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications,
      mobile applications (especially Android apps), and web applications. It is
      known for its portability across platforms, robustness, and security
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. It
      has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the
      world, with a large ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that
      support its development. Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it easier
      for developers familiar with those languages to learn. The language
      emphasizes code readability and maintainability, which contributes to its
      widespread adoption in various domains, including web development,
      enterprise applications, and scientific computing.
