    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for
      creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements
      and tags. HTML elements are represented by tags, which can include
      attributes to provide additional information about the element. HTML is
      used to define the content and layout of a webpage, including headings,
      paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more. It is often used in
      conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript
      for interactivity. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for its appearance.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce
      content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide
      information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers
      do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the
      page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
      JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
      inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer
      of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
      presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used
      to display video and audio, primarily using the element, together with
      JavaScript.
