    <h1>Django</h1>
    <p>
      Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid
      development and clean, pragmatic design. It was created to help developers
      build web applications quickly and efficiently, following the "don't
      repeat yourself" (DRY) principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Django provides a robust set of features, including an ORM
      (Object-Relational Mapping) system for database interactions, an admin
      interface for managing application data, and built-in security features to
      protect against common web vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which
      separates the data model, user interface, and business logic. Django is
      known for its scalability, making it suitable for both small projects and
      large-scale applications.
