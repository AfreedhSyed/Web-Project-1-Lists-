    <h1>Java Script</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming
      language. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
      and CSS, and enables interactive web pages. JavaScript is an event-driven,
      functional, and imperative language known for its versatility and wide
      range of applications. It can be used for client-side scripting in web
      browsers, server-side development with environments like Node.js, and even
      for mobile app development. JavaScript supports object-oriented
      programming concepts and has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
      that enhance its capabilities. It is widely used for creating dynamic
      content, handling user interactions, and building complex web
      applications.

      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-timeâ€“compiled language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
      include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
      facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
      JavaScript APIs for I/O. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name
      and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
