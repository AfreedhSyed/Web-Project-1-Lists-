      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the
      layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. CSS
      allows developers to separate content from design, making it easier to
      maintain and update websites. It supports responsive design, enabling
      websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. CSS can be
      applied inline, embedded in the HTML document, or linked as an external
      stylesheet. It uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles
      such as margins, padding, borders, and more. CSS is essential for creating
      visually appealing and user-friendly web experiences. Separation of
      formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
      page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
      on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
      and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternative
      formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[5] The name
      cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which
      declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a
      particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS
      specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
      Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by
      RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for
      CSS documents.[6]
