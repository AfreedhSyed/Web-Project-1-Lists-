    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>
      Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its
      readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first
      released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms,
      including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has
      a large standard library that provides tools suited for many tasks, making
      it a versatile language for various applications, from web development to
      data analysis and artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python's syntax emphasizes code readability, allowing developers to
      express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or
      Java. It uses dynamic typing and automatic memory management, which
      simplifies the development process. Python is widely used in scientific
      computing, data analysis, machine learning, web development, automation,
      and more. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as
      NumPy, Pandas, Django, and Flask, further enhances its capabilities and
      makes it a popular choice among developers.
