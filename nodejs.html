    <h1>Node JS</h1>
    <p>
      Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment
      that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is designed to
      build scalable network applications and is particularly well-suited for
      I/O-heavy tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it
      efficient and suitable for real-time applications. It allows developers to
      use JavaScript on the server side, enabling full-stack development with a
      single programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as
      Express.js, that simplify web application development. It is widely used
      for building APIs, microservices, and real-time applications like chat
      applications and online gaming.
