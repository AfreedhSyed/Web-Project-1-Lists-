    <h1>SQL</h1>
    <p>
      SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language
      used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users
      to create, read, update, and delete data stored in a database. SQL is
      widely used in various applications, from small-scale projects to large
      enterprise systems, due to its powerful capabilities and ease of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      SQL provides a set of commands and syntax for performing operations on
      databases, such as querying data with SELECT statements, inserting new
      records with INSERT statements, updating existing records with UPDATE
      statements, and deleting records with DELETE statements. It also supports
      advanced features like joins, subqueries, and transactions, enabling
      complex data retrieval and manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      SQL is essential for database administrators, developers, and data
      analysts as it allows them to interact with databases efficiently and
      effectively. Its declarative nature makes it easier to express what data
      is needed without specifying how to retrieve it, making SQL a powerful
      tool for data management.
