    <h1>Spring Framework</h1>
    <p>
      Spring Framework is a powerful, feature-rich framework for building Java
      applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for
      developing Java applications, making it easier to create robust and
      maintainable code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The framework is built around the concept of Inversion of Control (IoC)
      and Dependency Injection (DI), which promotes loose coupling between
      components. This allows developers to manage dependencies more effectively
      and enhances testability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring offers a wide range of features, including support for web
      applications (Spring MVC), data access (Spring Data), security (Spring
      Security), and integration with various technologies. It also provides a
      modular architecture, allowing developers to use only the components they
      need.
